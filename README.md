# airplane

A new Flutter project.

In making the “Airplane” application, we will learn from the Slicing design stage, implementing the BLoC (with Cubit) architecture to activating Null Safety on Flutter. BLoC (with Cubit) can simplify the state management process so that complex code becomes easier to test and use. Meanwhile, Null Safety can minimize errors on null (no data) so that it can increase application productivity. The combination of implementing good architecture and Null Safety can prevent crashes so that users can enjoy playing the application.

Key Points:
Deploy apps to Play Store
Building apps with Null Safety
Building applications with BLoC State Management (with Pinch)
Creating Slicing UI from Figma to app
